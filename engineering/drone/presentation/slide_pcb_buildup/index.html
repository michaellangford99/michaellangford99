<p>Our PCBs arrived this week from JLCPCB, allowing us to start the hardware build process. The boards look good, however not tenting the vias is going to make certain aspects of the board much harder to solder, on an already very dense and small pitch build. We’ll see how this goes. Figure 11- 1 shows one of the boards upon arrival.</p>
<p>First, I wanted to perform some electrical tests on the board, which it passed. I tested continuity for many different nets, particularly those with very tight trace tolerances. Next I tested the physical layout of the board by comparing it to the Pi Zero, onto which it needs to mount. I was happy to see the boards fit perfectly with the Pi Zero form factor and screw positions, as well as the communication connector lining right up with the Pi Zero header.</p>

<p>Once satisfied that the boards weren’t total trash, I began soldering, starting with the power supply, to verify that first. This board uses mostly 0603 SMT passive components, with a couple 0402s and 1206 &amp; 1210s for power capacitors. This means the lab doesn’t have the majority of the components we need. Thankfully, I have a personal stockpile of a variety of different 0603 SMT passives, and a few assorted 1206 &amp; 1210s from previous flight controller board projects.</p>

<p>I first laid out the components on the board without soldering, to get a sense of how everything was fitting, and if there were any mistakes with footprints. I then went into KiCAD and generated a plot of the reference designator and value of every component on the board, at much larger scale. This helps a lot when trying to figure out which miniscule SMT part goes where</p>

<p>First I soldered the power capacitors, 5V switching regulator, and then the ESC connector. I then tested the regulator by wiring the connector to the ESC and powering on, and measuring the voltage and ripple.</p>
<p>After this, I added all the 3.3V microcontroller caps, and then the microcontroller. This is one of the most difficult parts to solder, and definitely took a while. First I covered the board in flux, and brushed solder across the pads. Then I tacked a pin from each corner down, and then dragged the tinned iron across the pins. Next I added the programming header. At first this appeared to work, but after attempting to program with no success, I realized that some of the solder joints on the micro had very little solder, so I reheated multiple joints individually, and then the device was able to program.</p>

<p>After my less than excellent progress bricking a chip trying to get the IMU working, I decided to use the hot plate and reflow the entire top of the PCB in one shot. (Unfortunately, I didn’t get pictures of the stencil and reflow process, I was a little rushed) I started by organizing all the parts on a printout I developed last time to help place the parts with the right values in the right spots.</p>
<p>The stencil we purchased with our board came as a very large thin sheet of metal, with the small cutouts for our board in the center. This was way too large as is, cut it down to size first with a sheet cutter. With the stencil ready, I set up the board to be stenciled by using a metal right-angle of equal thickness to the PCB to secure the PCB on the table, and then taped the stencil down onto the PCB like a hinge.</p>
<p>Then I took the PCB with paste back to my station, and carefully placed each part onto it’s pads with tweezers, carefully aligning and double-checking them. Once I was confident the placement was correct and aligned, Joe helped me use the (very hot) hot plate to preheat my PCB, and then reflow the paste on the PCB. It was very cool to see the paste boil, the solder melt, and all the components float into place as the solder glistens. After the PCB cooled down, I washed it off and took a look at the results.</p>

<p>Nearly all the components were soldered correctly, but both IMUs, the micro, and the USB connector had shorts due to excess solder paste. The IMU joints were easy to clear, but the micro was surprisingly difficult. Joe had to help me clear them, but afterwards it looked quite nice. The USB was the most frustrating, as it had bridged ID and ground, and VUSB and ground. Anything shorted to ground on the USB connector is difficult to fix, as the USB connector sucks all the heat away as the iron tries to melt the joints. ID I left shorted, as the board doesn’t use it and the bus doesn’t care, but I was able to successfully clear the bridge with VUSB with lots of heat and flux.</p>
<p>Once the top of the PCB was complete, I went back and hand-soldered each cap onto the back of the PCB. This was pretty easy after doing the first board thankfully. After adding the 3.3V regulator, the board was ready to test.</p>

<p>Testing simply consisted of lots of continuity checks (and checks for shorts), and powering the board from the 3.3V supply on the programmer. With LEDs coming on properly, I programmed the board successfully with a ‘blink LED’ test program and then proceeded to test the USB-serial as well. Surprisingly, all hardware, even the IMU, worked first try. Good stuff.</p>

<p>Testing simply consisted of lots of continuity checks (and checks for shorts), and powering the board from the 3.3V supply on the programmer.

Surprisingly, all hardware, even the IMU, worked first try. Good stuff.</p>
