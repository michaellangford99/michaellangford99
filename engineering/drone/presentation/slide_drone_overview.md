**Project Overview:**
- Designed, built, and flew custom drone
- Completely custom flight controller hardware and software
- Required mechanical, hardware, software, and algorithm/signal processing skills to succesfully complete the project

**Objectives:**
- Custom flight controller to maintain flight, responsible for stabilization and altitude hold
- Pi zero to act as guidance and navigation computer, responsible for camera and LiDAR based obstacle avoidance and heading commands

**Results:**
- Succesfull flight controller design, stable and controlable flight with altitude hold
- Work remains for implementation of navigation capability, but effective system integration of the two modules
